\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Known errors in this version}

In the solutions to practice exercise in the appendix, although the hyperlinks to chapters work as intended, the links to Parts do not work properly. In all cases, they link back to exercises in Chapter 1. I haven't yet figured out how to fix this, but hope to do so in a future correction. (If you know how to fix it, please do send me a note.)

No doubt there are more errors yet-undiscovered. I am teaching with this version in January--April 2019; I expect that my students will help me find and correct more mistakes. I anticipate publishing a revised version in May 2019. I welcome suggestions and corrections from others too.
