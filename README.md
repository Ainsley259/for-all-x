# _forall x: UBC edition_

_forall x: UBC edition_ is an open-access introductory logic textbook. Professor Jonathan Ichikawa developed this text, based on [P. D. Magnus's _forall x_][16], in 2017–18, for use in PHIL 220: Introduction to Formal Logic at UBC, a course that he has been teaching since 2011. This text is produced under a Creative Commons License, and is free for all students and instructors worldwide.

The full book is available for pdf download [here][17]. Professor Ichikawa plans to make a printed version available as well, work in progress. If you'd like to modify it and know LaTeX, you may issue a pull request.

This repo is maintaining a list of know errors [here][19].

If you are enrolled in [Professor Ichikawa's PHIL 220 in January 2019][20], this will be your course textbook.

Here are a few points of information about the book:

* designed for a 13-week, introductory logic course with no prerequisites
* covers translation, proof systems, and some basic metatheory (soundness and completeness) for sentential and quantified logic, with identity
* covers both trees (analytic tableaux) and Fitch-style natural deduction systems, with its greater emphasis on trees
* emphasis on translation and laying the groundwork for metatheory; a lesser emphasis than some textbooks give on the ('puzzle-solving') details and mechanics of constructing proofs
* conversational style with fun examples; intended to be relatively accessible to the technically anxious
* free for anyone to use or modify
